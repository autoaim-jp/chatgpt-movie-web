They have turned their backs on each other, and they're walking down separate paths in a whimsical forest teeming with various types of plants. Kou and Yuu are small in size compared to the towering trees surrounding them. This image is expected to portray a sense of melancholic separation between the two bears, despite their cute outward appearances. There are no words or dialogues to be added.",
